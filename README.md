# Maltego Documentation

This documentation will serve as a user guide for the Silobreaker Maltego transforms. The documentation is automatically built (upon any updates to pages) by Github Pages and can be found on the web at https://silobreaker.github.io/MaltegoDocumentation. 

Developers should refer to [Local Setup](/setup/local_setup.md) for information on how to test and build the site locally.
